## I'm on a break.

After six years working at the same place I've taken some time off to recover from a little burnout and work on my own things for a while.

✅ chill out and recover from not liking computers any more  
✅ host a personal "cloud" in my homelab  
✅ make a new website ([Hello, World!](/2025/05/20/hello-world/))  
✅ configure my developer environment on my laptop  
📍 set up a Kubernetes cluster in my homelab  
🔲 write about what I know  
🔲 work on some new ideas  
???  
🔲 profit  

I'm also trying to get back into [microblogging](https://micro.paultibbetts.uk) and making writing a bigger part of my life.
