[IndieMark](https://indieweb.org/IndieMark) is an unofficial measure of how "IndieWeb" a website is.

I am using it here to measure my progress.

## Level 0

### Owning your own domain ✅

I have [written about getting my own domain](https://paultibbetts.uk/2025/09/09/getting-my-own-domain/).

### Having a personal site at that domain ✅

You're looking at it!

## Level 1

### Identity ✅

You're reading this on my primary domain. 

### Authentication ✅

#[e5e1d75](https://github.com/paultibbetts/paultibbetts.uk/commit/e5e1d7547f4b533db7e4ad80ca6d882bb278507f) added [`rel-me`](https://indieweb.org/rel-me) links to GitHub and Micro.blog.

### Posts

with **permalinks**, **h-entry** markup and other **microformats** ✅

#[24f53f0](https://github.com/paultibbetts/paultibbetts.uk/commit/24f53f0ca9101648c52cfc71438aba29f4c1e48e) added microformats to my posts.

### Searchable

by **allowing robots to index my site**, my **content is written in HTML** and **no JavaScript is required to read it** ✅

#[e5e1d75](https://github.com/paultibbetts/paultibbetts.uk/commit/e5e1d7547f4b533db7e4ad80ca6d882bb278507f) does all of the above.

## Level 2

The IndieWeb site defines level 2 as:

> much more than just "I started a blog"

### h-card

contact info and representative icon on my home page ✅

#[24f53f0](https://github.com/paultibbetts/paultibbetts.uk/commit/24f53f0ca9101648c52cfc71438aba29f4c1e48e) added a [`h-card`](https://indieweb.org/h-card) to the home page.

### Post multiple types of posts ❌

Right now I only write "[articles](https://paultibbetts.uk/articles)".

### POSSE to silos ❌

I don't use any of the silos and have no interest in posting there 🤷.

### Navigate across posts ❌

I will need to post more and consider a redesign to do this.

### Have a UI for searching ❌

I don't have enough posts to need this just yet.
