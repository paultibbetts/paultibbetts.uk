Shared the following quote by Jarod Kintz:

> Just because I liked something at one point in time doesn't mean I'll always like it, or that I have to go on liking it at all points in time as an unthinking act of loyalty to who I am as a person, based solely on who I was as a person. To be loyal to myself is to allow myself to grow and change, and challenge who I am and what I think.

> It will never be finished and it will never be perfect but that's the point.
> Each bug fixed is a problem solved, each experiment done is knowledge gained and each post written is documentation for the next time I have that problem.
