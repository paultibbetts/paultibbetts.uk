I don't like starting sentences with I.

There were also a few real technical difficulties starting a blog, which were more frustrating because usually I was the one who had caused them, but they were fixed pretty quickly.

No, the biggest problem came instead from me, not getting past the awkward part and making it a regular habit.

I made a slight effort earlier this year publishing a ["plan"](https://micro.paultibbetts.uk/2025/01/02/the-plan.html) on Micro.blog but apparently it wasn't the right time and I didn't follow it up. 

I was already aware of it, and making an effort to fix it, but I was burnt out.

What I didn't write in my "plan" was that I would be taking some time off work for a while to recover. It's not like I was stuck in bed, unable to move, but I had lost interest in coding and computers, which isn't great when that's what you do for money.

So I handed in my notice and took a break.

Two months later and I'm definitely feeling better.

The fact you are reading this at all is a testament to my newly rediscovered ability to sit down at a computer and not hate it.

I've also had the time to work on my homelab, on which I've made more progress in the last two weeks than I have in the last two years.

So maybe now is a good time to start blogging.
