My name's Paul. I grew up in Birmingham and now live in North Wales <span aria-hidden="true">🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿</span>.

I'm a software engineer with experience across the full web stack and the infrastructure that supports it. I've contributed to products used by some of the most recognisable names in tech.

In recent years I've focused on DevOps and Platform Engineering, building the foundations that enable teams to deploy, observe, and iterate on backend services with confidence.

## More about me

I learn best by experimenting, which is why I run my own [homelab](/tags/homelab). It's where I explore new tools, break things safely, and host the services I use every day.

Outside of work I like hiking and camping. Sometimes I [write about my trips](https://pinthewild.micro.blog).

My [now](/now) page shows what I'm currently up to and I also have a page for my [interests](/interests).

For a more formal summary of my professional experience you can read my [CV](/cv).

## This website

is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and my own custom theme that uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

It's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I'll move it someday, with [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) to manage the domain.
