My name's Paul. I grew up in Birmingham and am currently in North Wales.

I'm a DevOps Engineer with over 10 years of experience working on the web. 

You can also find shorter posts of mine on [micro.blog](https://micro.paultibbetts.uk).

My [now](/now) page shows what I'm currently up to.

## this website

is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and my own custom theme that uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

It's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I'll be moving it soon, with [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) to manage the domain.
