My name's Paul. I grew up in Birmingham and now live in North Wales.

I'm a software engineer with end-to-end experience across the full web stack and the infrastructure that supports it, contributing to products used by some of the most recognisable names in tech.

In recent years I've focused on DevOps and Platform Engineering, shaping release processes, making environments more predictable and improving overall system reliability.

I learn best by experimenting, which is why I run my own [homelab](/tags/homelab). It's where I explore new tools, break things safely, and host the services I use every day.

Outside of work I'm usually hiking and/or camping, and sometimes I [write about my trips](https://pinthewild.micro.blog).

My [now](/now) page shows what I'm currently up to.

## This website

is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and my own custom theme that uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

It's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I'll move it someday, with [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) to manage the domain.
